### Assigning work to the right people at the right time

## Problem Statement
Create a dynamic work allocation algorithm that optimizes the task assignment process within a software development team. The algorithm should consider various factors such as team members' skills, availability, and workload to ensure fair distribution of work and minimize bottlenecks.

## Hackathon
**Name:** EDEN 3.0  
**Host:** Marian College of Engineering, Trivandrum  
**Duration:** 24-hour hackathon held from May 13-14, 2024

## About the Project
Our software automates the employee work management system in companies, applicable to both technical and non-technical environments. It has the capability to assign tasks to the right employees by considering their availability, required skills, and, most importantly, their workload. The app has two divisions: the employer side and the employee side. Tasks created by the employer will be assigned to one of the employees considering the aforementioned factors.

## Key Features
- **Framework:** Built using Next.js
- **Authentication & Database:** Utilized Firebase for user authentication and as the database
- **Algorithm:** Implemented a special mathematical algorithm for understanding the workload of each employee
- **Task Progress:** Feature for monitoring the progress level of tasks

## Features to be Implemented
- **Hierarchical Functioning Structure:** For various employer levels
- **Group Chat Feature:** To facilitate better communication among team members
